## Features

- Generate a random password with a length of 1 to 256 characters.
- Options to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Adjustable password length through a slider or a number input field.
- Copy generated password to the clipboard.

## Structure

The application consists of three main parts:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that displays the user interface. It contains a form for generating passwords and a textarea for displaying the generated password.
- `generate_password.js`: This JavaScript file contains all the functionality for generating passwords. It uses event listeners to track changes in the form and generate a new password accordingly. It also adjusts the height of the textarea to fit the generated password and provides a function to copy the password to the clipboard.
- `main.js`: This JavaScript file sets up the Electron application, creating a new window and loading the HTML file into it. It also handles application events like closing all windows.

## Usage

To use this application, clone this repository to your local machine. Then, run the application with Electron:

```sh
electron main.js
```

This will open a new window where you can generate passwords.

## Dependencies

- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/): A framework for building cross-platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): A CSS framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites.
